## Introduction and goals
This program was created using the GO programming language. The aim of the project was to create a program that interferes with system files and control services via Windows 11 software

## Description of the project's operation
When you run the provided .exe file, you see a simple GUI on the monitor.

When you start the program, a stopwatch starts counting down to 5 minutes. This is the time to read the prepared message and follow the instructions to remove the threat. A place has been prepared that is responsible for "saving" our data. If you enter the appropriate code, the program stops working and the threat disappears, but if you enter the wrong code, you receive information about the error, but you can still try. The program also freezes the desktop and taskbar

**But, What's going on inside?**

When the program is launched, a second program is created in a location unknown to the user. This program is also started, which turns on the second stopwatch, also for 5 minutes. After the time expires, the program deletes the files contained on the user's drives
This program runs when the machine is restarted, so any attempt to reset the machine is useless.
